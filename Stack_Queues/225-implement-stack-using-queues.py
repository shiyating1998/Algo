# Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

# Implement the MyStack class:

# void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
# int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
# int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
# boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
# Notes:

# You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
 

# Example 1:

# Input
# ["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
# [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

# Explanation
# MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
# myStack.push(1);
# myStack.push(2);
# myStack.top(); // return 2
# myStack.pop(); // return 2
# myStack.empty(); // return False
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= x <= 9
# At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
# All the calls to pop and top are valid.
 

# Follow-up: Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []
        

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        ans = self.queue.pop(0)
        init = ans 
        while len(self.queue)>0 and self.queue[0] != init:
            self.queue.append(ans)
            ans = self.queue.pop(0)
        return ans 
        

    def top(self) -> int:
        ans = self.pop()
        self.queue.append(ans)
        return ans 

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.queue) == 0


# Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.empty()

# Note: Due to the limitation of the data structure, we couldn't achieve the same amortized O(1) time complexity as how we use two stacks to implement queues. 
# O(n) for pop and peek. 
# Also, my solution about is more than O(n) since pop(0) is O(n).
