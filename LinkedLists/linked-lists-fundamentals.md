## Linked lists

Linked lists is a data structure that holds the address of the next node. Stored in sparse memory, using pointers.

- O(1) insertion, deletion (if we don't need to traverse to the end of the list)
- O(n) access 

Advantages over Arrays
- Dynamic size, good for data that changes
- No need for contiguous memory

Types
- circular linked list
- doubly linked list
- singly linked list
