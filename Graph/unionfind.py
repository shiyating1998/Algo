# union find
# to find the number of connected components in a graph
# reprensented by using an array: parent, where parent[x] is the parent of node x 
# reflexive property: p & p are connected
# symmetric property: if p & q are connected, then q & p are connected
# transitive property: if p & q are connected and q & r are connected, then p & r are connected
