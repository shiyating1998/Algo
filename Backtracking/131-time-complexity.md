### Time Complexity Analysis

To analyze the **time complexity** of the given `partition` function, we need to consider:

1. **Partitioning of the string (`partition` function)**:
   - For a string of length \( n \), there are \( 2^{n-1} \) ways to partition it (inserting or not inserting a partition between each character). This comes from the fact that for each character except the last, we can either partition or not partition.

2. **Palindrome Checking (`isPalindrome` function)**:
   - The `isPalindrome` function checks if a substring is a palindrome by comparing characters at the beginning and end of the substring. In the worst case, it takes \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the length of the substring being checked.

3. **Recursive Backtracking (`h` function)**:
   - In the recursive function, for each substring starting at `startIndex`, it iterates through all possible partitions and recursively explores further partitions. The worst-case number of recursive calls is proportional to \( 2^n \), as each character may or may not be a partition.

#### Combining these factors:
- At each level of recursion, the function performs up to \( O(n) \) palindrome checks in the worst case.
- Each palindrome check can take \( O(n) \) time in the worst case.
- The number of possible partitions (and hence recursive calls) is \( 2^n \).

Thus, the **time complexity** is approximately:

\[
O(n \cdot 2^n)
\]

Here, \( O(n) \) accounts for the palindrome checks, and \( O(2^n) \) accounts for the number of possible partitions.

### Space Complexity Analysis

The space complexity is determined by:
1. The recursive call stack: \( O(n) \), since the depth of recursion can go up to \( n \).
2. The `path` and `result` lists: In the worst case, `result` stores \( 2^n \) partitions, and each partition can contain up to \( n \) substrings. Thus, the space required for `result` is \( O(n \cdot 2^n) \).

Overall, the **space complexity** is:

\[
O(n \cdot 2^n)
\]
